            I was an Associate Software Engineer with two years of experience in
            Full-Stack Development. With a passion for Frontend and Backend
            technologies, I have helped a number of clients and organizations
            achieve their specific goals or outcomes through my key contributions.
            As an Associate Software Engineer, I specialize in the MERN and MEAN
            stack, DBMS like MongoDB & SQL, Programming languages like Python & JS
            and including UIUX Design. I am committed to my professional values
            and mission and am constantly seeking new ways to achieve my
            professional development goals. I am also an avid Graphic designer who
